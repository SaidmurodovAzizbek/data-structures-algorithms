# ⚙️ Algorithms

This folder contains a collection of classic **algorithms** implemented in Python — from the simplest sorting techniques to advanced graph and dynamic programming solutions.

Each subfolder represents a different **category of algorithms**, with clear code, examples, and explanations aimed to help you **understand how each algorithm works** step by step.
