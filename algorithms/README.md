# ⚙️ Algorithms

This folder contains a collection of classic **algorithms** implemented in Python — from the simplest sorting techniques to advanced graph and dynamic programming solutions.

Each subfolder represents a different **category of algorithms**, with clear code, examples, and explanations aimed to help you **understand how each algorithm works** step by step.

```python
from algorithms.searching.linear_search import linear_search

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30

index = linear_search(arr, target)
print(index)  # Output: 2
